This project is made with SQL. I have done some queries on Covid-19 dataset.
Operations I have done are:
1.Looking total cases vs total deaths as Percentage.
2.Countries with the highest death percentage.
3.Global Numbers(death and total infection per day).
4.Looking at Total Population vs Vaccination using join function with anather dataset called vaccination.
5.Looking at the percentage of vaccination using CTE, 6.Creating View to store data for later Visualizations.
